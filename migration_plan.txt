# CLI Migration Plan

## Current State
- CLI is currently public in lib.rs
- main.rs uses it directly

## Target State  
- CLI should be private (not part of library API)
- Only main.rs should access it

## Migration Steps (v0.2.0)
1. Copy cli.rs content into main.rs
2. Make cli module private: pub(crate) mod cli
3. Update documentation

## Why Wait?
- Allows current code to work without major refactoring
- Can focus on building features first
- Clean break at v0.2.0
